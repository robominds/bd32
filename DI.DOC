BCCDI Prompt
============

The BCCDI prompt indicates whether the 68332 is running ('#' prompt) or
stopped ('%' prompt).  Most commands affecting the MCU, such as
read/write memory, register, etc, can only execute when the MCU is stopped.
An error message is displayed if the MCU is running.

BCCDI Command List
==================

ABORT
stop target MCU

	This command halts the 68332 by asserting BKPT on the background mode
	interface.

BR <n> <addr> <mask>

	This command sets an address and mask value into the comparitor
	register given by <n>.  n may be 0 to 3.  The MSB of the address and
	mask are composed of several control signals as listed below:

Bit     31      30      29      28      27      26      25      24
Signal  DS      AS      SIZ1    SIZ0    R/W     FC2     FC1     FC0

	The lower three bytes contain the 24 bit breakpoint address.

CALL <addr>
call user code patch

	This function calls a user subroutine, stopping the 68332 when an RTS
	is executed.

ECHO [X]
turn off/toggle character echo

	ECHO toggles the character echo on the DI serial port.  ECHO X turns
	off the echo unconditionally.

GO [<addr>]
start execution at PC or specified address

	GO restarts the aborted MCU.  If an address is specified on the
	command line, execution resumes from that address, otherwise the
	contents of the program counter are used as the start of execution.

HELP

	This command was listed in the EVS manual but when I tried it the
	only response from the DI was "Consult Manual".  Thanks for the help!

NMI
assert level 7 interrupt on 332

	I haven't tried this one but I assume it works.

NOBR <n>
disable breakpoint register n

	This (I assume) turns off the breakpoint in the register indicated by
	n.

MR <size> <address>
memory read

	This performs a read from memory at the address specified.  The size
	must also be specified;  either B,W, or L is legal.  The result will
	be printed in hex.

MW <size> <address> <data>
memory write

	A memory write is performed at the specified address, with the given
	size.

PROG

	At the moment I have no idea how this command works.

RC <addr>
read comparitor

	The specified address in the breakpoint gate array is read and
	returned as a 32 bit number.  The address may range from 0 to 3F.

RD <regname>
read CPU register

WR <regname> <value>
write CPU register

        The contents of the specified CPU register are displayed (written).
        The name used to specify a register is given below:

	A0 through A6, D0 through D7            use name as is
	PC (program counter)                    S0
	VBR (vector base register)              SA
	SR (status register)                    SB
	USP (user stack pointer)                SC
	SSP (system stack pointer)              SD
	SFC (source function code reg.)         SE
	DFC (destination function code reg.)    SF

RESET <type>

	The 68332 is reset.  Either a full hardware reset is performed (type
	= 'H'), or just a software reset (type = 'S').

STAT

	This command will display the status of the Freeze, Halt, and Reset
	inputs into the 68332.
